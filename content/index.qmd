On each class session page you'll see buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:

<p class="buttons" style="text-align:center;"><span class="btn btn-danger">{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-danger">{{< fa file-pdf >}} Download PDF of all slides</span></p>

The slides are also embedded on each page. You can click in the slides and navigate through them with <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands (like <kbd>f</kbd> for fullscreen).
